# videodownloader
A simple python video downloader

install:
First of all inside the folder of where the videodownloader.py will be located create another folder named "video" it will be used to upload the output videos directly into that folder.

`pip install pytube`

`python3 videodownloader.py`

this python file works only on pc, maybe in the future I will create a version that also works from the phone.
